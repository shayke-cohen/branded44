# 403 Forbidden Error Investigation & Fix

## Problem
The services screen is showing "No services found" and the browser console shows 403 Forbidden errors when trying to access the Wix Booking API.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What is a 403 Forbidden Error?
A 403 error means the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. In the context of Wix APIs, this typically indicates:

1. **Missing App Installation**: The required Wix app (Bookings) is not installed on the site
2. **Insufficient Permissions**: The API client doesn't have permission to access the requested resources
3. **Configuration Issues**: The app is installed but not properly configured for public/visitor access
4. **No Content**: The app is installed but no services have been created

### Specific to Wix Bookings API
The 403 error when accessing `/bookings/v2/services/query` most commonly means:

1. **Wix Bookings App Not Installed**: The site doesn't have the Wix Bookings app installed
2. **No Services Created**: The app is installed but no booking services have been configured
3. **Services Not Published**: Services exist but are not published or publicly accessible
4. **Visitor Access Disabled**: Services are published but visitor/public access is disabled
