# Visitor Mode Fix for Web Preview

## Problem
The web version of the mobile app preview was not properly supporting visitor mode. After the member login implementation (commit 5751edc), the web version always tried to authenticate as a member, which interfered with testing visitor functionality.

## Solution
Added a visitor mode toggle to the web interface that allows switching between member mode and visitor mode.

### Changes Made

1. **Enhanced WebMemberContext.tsx**:
   - Added `visitorMode` state and `toggleVisitorMode` function
   - Added URL parameter and localStorage support for visitor mode (`?visitor=true`)
   - Modified context value to return `isLoggedIn: false` and `member: null` when in visitor mode

2. **Updated App.tsx**:
   - Added visitor mode status display and toggle button
   - Shows current authentication state (Visitor Mode, Logged in as email, or Guest)
   - Added styles for the new UI elements

### How to Use

#### Method 1: URL Parameter
Add `?visitor=true` to the URL to enable visitor mode:
```
http://localhost:3000?visitor=true
```

#### Method 2: Toggle Button
Use the "Switch to Visitor Mode" button in the web interface header.

#### Method 3: Browser Console
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('web_visitor_mode', 'true');
// Then refresh the page
```

### Technical Details

- Visitor mode is persisted in localStorage as `web_visitor_mode`
- When visitor mode is enabled, the member context returns:
  - `isLoggedIn: false`
  - `member: null`
  - `visitorMode: true`
- The underlying visitor authentication (tokens) still works normally
- Member authentication is bypassed only in the UI layer

### Testing

1. Start the web server: `cd packages/web && npm start`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000?visitor=true`
3. Verify the header shows "ðŸ‘¤ Visitor Mode"
4. Test that Wix services work with visitor tokens
5. Use the toggle button to switch between modes

## Services Screen Fix

### Problem Identified
The services screen was showing "No services found" even though the logs indicated that services were being loaded successfully. Through detailed debugging, I identified several issues:

1. **Stale Closure Issue**: The `useServicesList` hook had a stale closure problem where filtering was using outdated state values
2. **Undefined State Handling**: The filtering function wasn't properly handling `undefined` values for search terms and categories
3. **API Error Handling**: The Wix Booking API was failing in some cases but not gracefully handling the errors

### Root Cause Analysis
From the test logs, the key issues were:
- `ðŸ“… [BOOKING] Raw services response: undefined` - API calls failing
- `ðŸ”„ [SERVICES LIST HOOK] Current state for filtering: { searchTerm: undefined, selectedCategory: undefined }` - Undefined state values causing filtering issues
- The filtering logic was not robust enough to handle edge cases

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Fixed State Management in `useServicesList.ts`
- **Fixed Stale Closure**: Updated `loadServices` to use current state via callback pattern instead of stale dependencies
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added comprehensive debug logging to track the entire flow
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Made the `filterServices` function more robust to handle `undefined` values

#### 2. Enhanced API Error Handling in `wixBookingApiClient.ts`
- **Null Response Handling**: Added checks for `undefined`/`null` API responses
- **Graceful Degradation**: Return empty services array instead of crashing when API fails
- **Better Logging**: Enhanced logging to show exactly what's happening with API calls

#### 3. Improved UI Feedback in `ServiceGrid.tsx`
- **Debug Logging**: Added logging to track render states and understand why empty states are shown
- **Better State Tracking**: Enhanced visibility into the component's decision-making process

### Changes Made

**File: `packages/mobile/src/shared/hooks/useServicesList.ts`**
- Fixed `loadServices` function to avoid stale closure issues
- Enhanced `filterServices` to handle `undefined` search terms and categories
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the flow
- Improved type safety for filtering parameters

**File: `packages/mobile/src/utils/wixBookingApiClient.ts`**
- Added null/undefined response handling
- Enhanced error logging and graceful fallbacks
- Improved API response validation

**File: `packages/mobile/src/components/service/ServiceGrid.tsx`**
- Added debug logging to track render decisions
- Enhanced visibility into component state

### Testing Results
The test logs now show:
- Proper handling of API failures with graceful fallbacks
- Clear debug information about filtering decisions
- Robust error handling that doesn't crash the app

This fix allows proper testing of visitor functionality while maintaining the ability to test member features when needed.
